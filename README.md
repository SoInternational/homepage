3. Run `npm start` to test locally.

## Adding Blog Posts

Add a markdown file with the filename format `<YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DAY>-<TITLE>.md` to the [docs/posts](docs/posts) directory.

- Hyphens in the title will be replaced with spaces.
- [URL encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) characters in the title will be decoded.

Edit the markdown file to write the post.

 - Add images to the [docs/posts/assets](docs/posts/assets) directory and reference them in the usual markdown way: `![title](assets/<filename>)`
